# Switching API — Production Acceptance Checklist

> **Phase 0 — Production Baseline Freeze**
> Created: 2026-05-14
> Purpose: Go / No-Go criteria for each production readiness phase.
> Status legend: `[ ]` Not started · `[~]` In progress · `[x]` Done · `[!]` Blocked

---

## How to Use

Before each phase sign-off, every item in that phase's section must be `[x]` or explicitly `ACCEPTED` with a documented reason. Any `[ ]` or `[!]` is a **hard blocker** for that phase unless escalated to the risk register as ACCEPTED.

### Test Cleanup
- [ ] `@AfterEach` cleanup added to all integration tests (prevent data accumulation)
- [ ] Unit tests separated from integration tests (Maven Surefire groups or separate source sets)
- [ ] `scripts/run_tests.sh` passes against locally running app

### CI Pipeline
- [x] CI config file created: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- [x] CI runs on every `push` and `pull_request`
- [x] CI job 1: compile
- [x] CI job 2: unit tests (no DB)

- [x] CI job 5: Docker image build (only after package)
- [x] CI job 6: push to registry (only on `main` branch)
- [x] CI fails fast: each job uses `needs:` to block on failure
- [x] Test reports stored as CI artifacts
- [ ] PR branch protection rule configured (requires status checks to pass)

### Dockerfile Fix
- [ ] `Dockerfile` build stage does NOT use `-DskipTests` in production build target
- [ ] Optional: `Dockerfile` has a `dev` target with `-DskipTests` for local developer builds

**Phase 1 Exit Criteria:**

- [x] CI pipeline created and blocks on failure
- [ ] Dockerfile production build runs tests (not `-DskipTests`)
- [ ] PR branch protection enabled on `main`

---

## Phase 2 — Production Configuration Checklist

**Goal:** Secrets never in code. Prod fails fast on missing config.

### Profile Separation
- [ ] 4 Spring profiles defined and documented: `dev`, `test`, `staging`, `prod`
- [ ] Each profile's `application-{profile}.yml` differences documented
- [ ] `staging` profile uses real DB credentials (not demo), mirrors `prod` as closely as possible
- [ ] `prod` profile does not include any dev or test defaults

### Startup Guards (prod profile)
- [ ] App fails to start if `MESSAGE_CRYPTO_KEY_BASE64` is blank in prod
- [ ] App fails to start if `DB_PASSWORD` is not set (no default)
- [ ] App fails to start if `API_KEY_AUTH_ENABLED` is not `true` in prod
- [ ] App fails to start if `RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED` is not `true` in prod
- [ ] `JSON_INITIATION_ENABLED` defaults to `false` in prod (ISO-only mode)
- [ ] Actuator exposure in prod: `health,info` only (never `metrics` without auth)

### Demo Keys Removal
- [ ] Demo API keys (`sk-admin-switching-2026` etc.) disabled in production migration
- [ ] Production key provisioning procedure documented (how to create first ADMIN key)
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials anywhere in `src/` (git grep for `sk-admin`, `sk-ops`, `sk-bank`)

### Secrets Management
- [ ] Decision made: Vault / AWS Secrets Manager / K8s Secrets / `.env` pipeline injection
- [ ] All secrets injected via chosen method (not stored in `application.yml`)
- [ ] `.env` file is in `.gitignore` and never committed
- [ ] Secrets rotation procedure documented

**Phase 2 Exit Criteria:**
- [ ] Production cannot start with any missing secret
- [ ] No demo credentials can authenticate in production
- [ ] Staging config documented and deployed

---

## Phase 5 — Reliability & Outbox Advanced Checklist

**Goal:** No duplicate dispatch. No lost event. Idempotency solid.

### Multi-Instance Safety
- [ ] Concurrency test: 2 app instances compete for same outbox event → only 1 wins
- [ ] `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` or `UPDATE WHERE status='PENDING'` confirmed in claim logic
- [ ] No duplicate `SUCCESS` event for same `transferRef` in any concurrent test scenario

### Retry & Backoff
- [ ] `next_retry_at` populated consistently on each retry
- [ ] Exponential backoff implemented: 30s → 2min → 10min
- [ ] Outbox poller filters: `next_retry_at IS NULL OR next_retry_at <= NOW()`
- [ ] Backoff tested: retried event is not re-processed until `next_retry_at`

### Audit Trail for Manual Actions
- [ ] `OUTBOX_MANUAL_RETRY` audit log event written on every manual retry
- [ ] `OUTBOX_MARK_REVIEWED` audit log event written on every mark-reviewed
- [ ] Audit log includes: actor (from API key), outbox event ID, previous status, timestamp

### Idempotency Tests
- [ ] Concurrent POST `/api/transfers` with same idempotency key → exactly 1 transfer created
- [ ] Concurrent POST `/api/iso20022/pacs008` with same `MsgId` → second call rejected
- [ ] Concurrent POST `/api/iso20022/acmt023` with same `InstructionId` → second call rejected

### ISO Path Reliability
- [ ] Inquiry TTL enforced: PACS.008 with expired `InquiryRef` is rejected
- [ ] `inquiry_status_history` writes status transitions for ISO path (not just JSON path)

**Phase 5 Exit Criteria:**
- [ ] Duplicate dispatch test passes under 2-instance concurrent load
- [ ] Retry backoff confirmed in integration test
- [ ] All manual actions create audit records

---
